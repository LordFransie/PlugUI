THIS CODE IS BETA QUALITY

Note1: during development it is necessary for you to create a few directories first: 

	'/etc/installed_apps'
	'/var/run/PlugUI'
	'/var/lib/PlugUI'

	these are needed to store files that change and can't be kept with the main PlugUI code.


Deployment for development or use:

Step 1: clone the git tree: "cd /opt; git clone git://github.com/plugapps/PlugUI.git" 

	(if you wish to help with development, fork the tree on github instead and clone your own tree so you can commit and we can pull from you)

Step 2: install python and the cherrypy code: "pacman -S python2 cherrypy"

	PlugUI is written with the Django framework, but we are using the cherrpy webserver because it is fast, light and supports large file downloads

Step 3: synchronize the database 'cd /opt/PlugUI/; python2 manage.py syncdb'

	create a user when asked, this is the super user who has access to the web interface by default. you can create other users later from the interface. 

Step 4: run the server: 'cd /opt/PlugUI; python2 manage.py runcpserver'

Step 5: type your plugs IP address in a web browser, enter the username you created earlier when asked.
