THIS CODE IS BETA QUALITY

To deploy for development just clone the git tree inside /opt/ , navigate to the directory and run "python2.7 manage.py runserver". This will be a single threaded server so it may be slow, but it will let you easily test the code and work on it.

To deploy for use, clone the git tree into /opt/ then run "pacman -S python-distribute", then "easy_install-2.7 fapws3". Fapws is the python webserver being used to deploy the code, it is high performance and very light on resources.

Then to run the server, change to the plugui directory and run "./plugui start". Alternatively you can symlink from /etc/rc.d/plugui to /opt/PlugUI/plugui so it will act as a well behaved arch daemon.
